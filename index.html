    <h2>More About Our Cutie</h2>

    <p>
      She laughs a little louder when she’s really happy,
      pretends she’s not emotional (but absolutely is),
      and somehow remembers the smallest details about everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      She loves deeply, cares fiercely, and brings comfort
      just by being around. This section exists because
      some things deserve more than just one paragraph.
